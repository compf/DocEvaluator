  abstract  = {An important software engineering artefact used by developers and maintainers to assist in software comprehension and maintenance is source code documentation. It provides insights that help software engineers to effectively perform their tasks, and therefore ensuring the quality of the documentation is extremely important. Inline documentation is at the forefront of explaining a programmer's original intentions for a given implementation. Since this documentation is written in natural language, ensuring its quality needs to be performed manually. In this paper, we present an effective and automated approach for assessing the quality of inline documentation using a set of heuristics, targeting both quality of language and consistency between source code and its comments. We apply our tool to the different modules of two open source applications (ArgoUML and Eclipse), and correlate the results returned by the analysis with bug defects reported for the individual modules in order to determine connections between documentation and code quality.},

  abstract = {The importance of software documentation and the effects of poor documentation in data processing are often underrated. Little research has been published that evaluates the quality of software documentation. The evaluation of textual attributes such as comprehensibility, readability, etc., has seen more studies and relatively sound results. Thus this paper exclusively handles textual documentation, whereby the methods are employed for the evaluation of software documentation. We first introduce the methods used in the measurement of text comprehensibility. Then RMS (Readability Measuring System), a tool developed by the author to support the measuring process, is presented. The third part of the paper presents empirical results and discusses the experience gained in the application of the RMS tool.},

  abstract  = {Exstatic is a generic static checker developed by the author to address many of the
practical problems in program development. Static checking provides a valuable means
for automating time consuming checks not only concerned with program correctness (writing
the right program), but also to do with style (writing the program right). Previous
static checkers have been closely coupled with compilation systems, and therefore
tend to be applicable to the code itself and not to all of the textual information
(such as makefiles, comments, documentation sources) surrounding the code. The generic
nature of Exstatic allows it to overcome these boundaries, and indeed it can be applied
to any medium for which there is a formally definable syntax and (to an extent) semantics.
Exstatic can therefore be used to increase the productivity and quality of documentation
of programs, checking for such things as adherence to house style, consistency with
the program being documented and self consistency. This paper describes the design
and use of Exstatic, with particular reference to its use in documentation systems.},

The Linux kernel team, for example, developed Coccinelle, a powerful tool for searching,
analyzing, and rewriting C source code; because the Linux kernel contains more than
27 million lines of code, a static-analysis tool is essential both for finding bugs
and for making automated changes across its many libraries and modules. Another tool
targeted at the C family of languages is Clang scan-build, which comes with many useful
analyses and provides an API for programmers to write their own analyses. Like so
many things in computer science, the utility of static analysis is self-referential:
To write reliable programs, we must also write programs for our programs. But this
is no paradox. Static-analysis tools, complex though their theory and practice may
be, are what will enable us, and engineers of the future, to overcome this challenge
and yield the knowledge and insights that we practitioners deserve.},

software documentation tools. Participants agree that documentation tools should seek
to better extract knowledge from core resources. These resources include the system's
source code, test code and changes to both. Resulting technologies could then help
reduce the effort required for documentation maintenance, something that is shown
to rarely occur. Our data reports compelling evidence that software professionals

The Documentation Maturity Model (DMM) is specifically targeted towards assessing the quality of documentation used in aiding program understanding. Software engineers and technical writers produce such documentation during regular product development lifecycles. The documentation can also be recreated after the fact via reverse engineering. The DMM has both process and product components; this paper focuses on the product quality aspects.},

  abstract  = { Test suites should test exceptional behavior to detect faults in error-handling code. However, manually-written test suites tend to neglect exceptional behavior. Automatically-generated test suites, on the other hand, lack test oracles that verify whether runtime exceptions are the expected behavior of the code under test.  This paper proposes a technique that automatically creates test oracles for exceptional behaviors from Javadoc comments. The technique uses a combination of natural language processing and run-time instrumentation. Our implementation, Toradocu, can be combined with a test input generation tool. Our experimental evaluation shows that Toradocu improves the fault-finding effectiveness of EvoSuite and Randoop test suites by 8% and 16% respectively, and reduces EvoSuite’s false positives by 33%. },

  abstract = {The Software Assurance Technology Center (SATC) has developed a software metrics program consisting of goals, attributes and metrics to support the assessment of project status, risk, and product quality throughout the life cycle. The objective of the software metrics program is to assess risk areas at each phase of the development life cycle and project them into the future. The software development goals in the metrics program are evaluated by a set of attributes that help to define and classify risks. The attributes must be “measurable” by a set of metrics. These metrics must be based on data that is collectable within the confines of the software development process and must also be relevant to the quality attributes and risk assessment. This paper discusses the SATC's software risk assessment metrics program which meets these needs and is currently being applied to software developed for NASA. At each phase of the software development life cycle, attributes will be identified and metrics defined. Project data is used to demonstrate how the metric analysis was applied at that phase for risk assessment, and how that information could be used by management to manage project risks.},
